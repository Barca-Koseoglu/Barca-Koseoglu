# ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Barca Koseoglu

I'm a senior in high school taking classes at the University of Minnesota and Metropolitan State University with a strong foundation in mathematics, programming, and analytical problem-solving. I want to pursue undergraduate studies in Data Science and Computer Science at a school like MIT.

My passion lies in developing machine learning models, exploring algorithmic problem-solving, and building with cloud technologies like AWS.

* **Algorithmic Problem-Solving (LeetCode)**
    * Authored a GitHub repository with 100+ Python solutions showcasing mastery of data structures and algorithms.
    * Implemented techniques such as Dynamic Programming, Tree Traversal, and two-pointer methods.

* **Sentiment Analysis Model**
    * Built a sentiment analysis model using Logistic Regression and TF-IDF on 500 text samples.
    * Compared Optuna and GridSearchCV for hyperparameter tuning based on precision, recall, and F1-score.

* **AI Coursework & Article Repository**
    * Created a GitHub repository summarizing key AI concepts from Harvard's CS50 AI course, including search, logic, and probabilistic models.

* **Advent of Code Solutions (2024)**
    * Developed and published Python solutions for Advent of Code 2024 challenges, demonstrating strong problem-solving under time constraints.
